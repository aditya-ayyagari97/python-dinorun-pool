This is my personal favourite. This involves some Machine Learning and Automation.
Look out for the performance graph in the tutorial.

__Features__:

- Uses Reinforcement Learning

- Auto-restart when the game gets over

- Learns over time

- Capable of achieving high scores

__To read__ : Please read this [blog](https://blog.paperspace.com/dino-run/) to understand how the pragram works.

## 2. PyAutoGUI

This is a pretty straight forward approach. Recommended for beginners.

__Features__:

- Uses PyAutoGUI

- Programmed to automate the key press

__Limitations__:

- Loses efficiency as the game progresses and becomes fast

- Caliberation according to the desktop dimensions has to be manually done


__To watch__ : Please watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXz2nFNuNJU#action=share) for the tutorial.
